# Forbidden-words hygiene guard — scans the tree for two classes of content that must NEVER be committed:
#   1. generic CREDENTIAL SHAPES (private keys, PAT/token prefixes, AWS key ids, Grafana tokens) — the
#      built-in base set below; public patterns, always scanned even without the deployment list (catches
#      pasted secrets).
#   2. deployment-specific IDENTIFIERS (customer names, internal hostnames, account ids, sibling repos)
#      — sensitive, so kept OUT of this repo. Loaded from, in order:
#        a. $FORBIDDEN_WORDS_PATTERN      — a ready alternation regex (CI, injected from a secret)
#        b. scripts/forbidden-words.local — gitignored; one regex fragment per line (#-comments + blanks ok)
#      Absent (e.g. a fork PR / fresh clone) → only the credential shapes are scanned.
# This is a lightweight guard, NOT a full secret scanner — gitleaks (CI) + GitHub secret scanning (once
# public) are the comprehensive layer. See scripts/forbidden-words.local.example for the list format.
#
# Runs at two points: the pre-commit hook (staged files) and CI (`make forbidden-words`, via `make gate`).
# Portable (bash 3.2 / macOS): no mapfile / associative arrays.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/forbidden-words.sh            # scan the whole tree
#   scripts/forbidden-words.sh <files...> # scan only these (pre-commit passes staged files)
